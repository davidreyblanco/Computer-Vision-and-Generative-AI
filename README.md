# Introduction

This projects contains the assignment for the course "Computer Vision and Generativa AI". The code needed to make the exercise work has been added within the *starter.ipynb* notebook.

# Additional tasks

## Alternative inpainting / prompt tests

On the other hand the original notebook was modified to generate an alternative "car" image, that can be found in the folder "screenshot". It was generated a new image with a car in the rainforest.

## SAM / Inpainting

I have done two tests with SAM plus inpainting over a new image (attached as the name of kim.png") for:

* Inpaint on the background, the result can be found at *screenshots/gradio-sam-inpaint-background.png*.
* Inpaint on the foreground, the result can be found at *screenshots/gradio-sam-inpaint-foreground.png*.

## Other

The *app.py* file has been slightly modified to include a new picture called "kim.png"
